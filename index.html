            <h2>Alex Turner</h2>
            <p>Lead Vocal</p>
            <p>Alex Turner, the lead vocalist and lyricist of Stage Fright, 
                is a shy and introspective yet charismatic figure. He often 
                retreats into the world of music whenever he needs a means of 
                escape. His first introduction to music was at age 10 when he 
                encountered a live performance in his hometown of Ohio. The 
                raw energy and emotion displayed by the band lit a fire in 
                Alex. His awkwardness grew into quiet rebellion, which made 
                him an ideal frontman for a rock band, though he didn't always 
                feel at ease with the spotlight. His source of inspiration 
                behind his lyrics came from all the feelings of isolation, 
                self-doubt, and pressure he faced during his course of life. 
                He had a distinct, almost haunting voice that could go from 
                fragile and delicate to fiery and intense, which set him apart 
                from other singers in the local scene. Alex frequently battled 
                with insecurity, constantly feeling like an outsider in the 
                music industry. However, this vulnerability became the fuel 
                for his unique vocal style: a mix of delicate falsetto, gritty 
                growls, and passionate delivery that resonated with fans on a 
                personal level.

                <h2>Jamie Smith</h2>
                <p>Guitarist</p>
                <p>Jamie Smith, the guitarist of Stage Fright, grew up in the 
                    bustling city of New York City, a place where the streets 
                    hum with the sounds of both struggle and creativity. He had 
                    always been drawn to the various sounds of daily life and 
                    frequently spent his afternoons sitting on the sidewalks of 
                    Lower Manhattan. At 12 years old, he discovered his father's 
                    dusty, old acoustic guitar hidden in a closet. The first strum 
                    of the guitar let out the most melodic tune Jamie had ever 
                    heard. For the next few months, Jamie would save his allowance, 
                    and when he had enough, he bought an old electric guitar. Jamie 
                    would spend hours on end teaching himself by listening to various 
                    albums. He gained a liking to classic rock bands and began 
                    replicating various guitar riffs that he liked. He quickly 
                    developed an ear for complex melodies and could mimic solos after 
                    just a few listens. While he had technical talent, his real gift 
                    lay in his ability to make his guitar sing, capturing emotions in 
                    his playing that words couldn’t express.

            <h2>Taylor Green</h2>
            <p>Bassist</p>
            <p>Taylor Green, the bassist of Stage Fright, is the quiet force that 
                anchors the band's sound. Born by the ocean in Boston, Massachusetts, 
                he provides the groove and the grounding with his calm but confident 
                bass sound. His first encounter with a bass guitar was in middle school. 
                A friend introduced him to a local punk band, and during one of their 
                rehearsals, the bassist was absent. Taylor, curious about the role of 
                bass in music, picked up the instrument and began playing along. It was 
                an instant connection. The deep, rhythmic thrum of the bass felt like the 
                pulse of the music, and he was captivated. On his 13th birthday, Taylor was 
                gifted his very own bass guitar, and since then, the bass guitar has never 
                left his side. He used every waking moment learning every bassline he could 
                find, sneaking into clubs to watch bands play, and dreaming of bigger stages. 
                For Taylor, the bass was not just an instrument; it was a way to feel 
                connected to the heartbeat of music itself.

                <h2>Morgan Lee</h2>
                <p>Drummer</p>
                <p>Morgan Lee, the drummer of Stage Fright, is the rhythmic heartbeat 
                    of the band. While neither of his parents had occupations as 
                    musicians, they both shared a love for classic rock. As a result of 
                    this and the fact that he was born in the music hub of Nashville, 
                    Tennessee, Morgan grew up surrounded by music. However, it was his 
                    neighbor's drum set that caught Morgan's attention when he was 11 years 
                    old. He spent hours visiting his neighbor and hearing him play the drums. 
                    At the age of 14, Morgan picked up his first drum kit, a secondhand set 
                    he saved up for by mowing lawns and doing odd jobs around his 
                    neighborhood. He started teaching himself the basics, banging away on the 
                    set in his garage, never bothering with traditional lessons. To him, it 
                    wasn’t about perfection; it was about feeling the rhythm, the power, and 
                    the release of the drums. By the time he was in high school, Morgan had 
                    formed a few bands, always drawn to the energy of live shows and the 
                    catharsis of performing. He found his groove in the rock scene, where raw 
                    passion trumped perfection.
